dveme: dwe (two) + ime (these)

      => extremes
pabbajitena => pabbajati: monk; one who has gone from the home

4. "Yo cāyaṃ kāmesu kāmasukhallikānuyogo hīno
    gammo pothujjaniko anariyo anatthasaṃhito, yo
    cāyaṃ attakilamathānuyogo dukkho anariyo
    anatthasaṃhito.

Yo => ya: "that which is" / any practice
cāyaṃ => ca: and (referring to kamesu+kamasukallikanuyogo), then/now
kāmesu => kāma: pleasure, giving an object of sensual enjoyment
       => locative case ("in")
kāmasukhallikānuyogo => [guesses] kāma (lust) + sukhalli (pleasurable)
                     => kāma (lust) + sukha (comfort) + ā (toward) + anuyoga (practice / devotion)
                     => kāma (lust) + sukhallikānuyogo (luxurious living)
                     => kama + sukha + allika + anuyoga
hīno => hīna: low, vile, base, contemptable
gammo => gamma: "belonging to the village", common, pagan
pothujjaniko (breakdown?) => pothujjanika: belonging to the common man

anariyo: an (not) + ariyo (noble)
anatthasaṃhito: anattha (harm, misfortune)
                 + saṃhita (equipped with, possessed of, connected to)
=> an (not) + attha (purpose, benefit, goal)

=> Any practice of engaging in sensual pleasures or the practice of moving toward comforts and lust is low and vile. It is belonging to the village, common -- these behaviours belong to the common person, are not noble (not pursusing the path), and equip a person with misfortune.

yo: any practice / "that which is"
cāyaṃ => ca: and, then/now
attakilamathānuyogo => attakilamatha (self-mortification) + anuyoga (practice / devotion)
                    => attakilamatha => atta (self) + kilamatha (tiredness / fatigue / exhaustion)
dukkho: suffering
anariyo: not noble

5. Ete kho, bhikkhave, ubho ante anupagamma
   majjhimā paṭipadā
   tathāgatena abhisambuddhā cakkhukaraṇī
   ñāṇakaraṇī upasamāya abhiññāya
   sambodhāya nibbānāya saṃvattati”.

Ete kho: surely this
bhikkhave: monks
ubho: both (vestigial usage)
ante => anta: the end(s), the goal(s)
anupagamma: an (negated) upagamma (approached) => turned away from
            => anu () + pa (not) + gamma => not to be followed? (klaus)
            => anu + pagamma
majjhimā: middle, medium, moderate, central
paṭipadā: The Way, means of reaching a goal or destination
tathāgatena => tathagata: Enlightened One (presumed historical)
       -ena: instrumental case (with / by / to)
abhisambuddhā: abhi (mastering) + sambuddha (highest wisdom)
               => "awakened" (to the middle path)
cakkhukaraṇī: cakkhu (eyes) + karana (doing)
              => "eyes of dhamma"? / "one's own eyes"
ñāṇakaraṇī: ñāṇa (wisdom / insight) + karaṇī (doing => enlightening)
            => "one's own action"
    -aṇī (applies to 'majjhima patipada')
    -karaṇī (adj.)
upasamāya => upasama: calmness, tranquilizing
          => ...of impurities
abhiññāya => (abs. of abhijānāti): possessed of (supranormal) knowledge
          => abhiññā - heavenly ear, knowing other's thoughts, knowing previous
                       births, etc.
          => From Satipattana Discourse:
             1. Sanjanati - w sankhara / sanna
             2. Pajanati - knowing as it is
             3. Sampajanati - "up to the boundary" (boundary = mind-body)
             4. Abhijanati - "going beyond the boundary"
sambodhāya => sambodha: insight belonging to the three higher stages of the path
nibbānāya => nibbāna: extinction of a fire, emancipation, final bliss
    -āya (dative: applies to 'saṃvattati' = "middle way *leads* to X")
saṃvattati => vattati: exists, goes on (completely) - third person singular

=> Certainly in this way, monks, the Tathagata has turned away from these two goals, turning
   instead to the Middle Way to master the highest wisdom, to see clearly, the produce the
   highest insight, to feel ultimate calm, to become possessed of supranormal knowledge,
   to become completely awakened / fully enlightened, to experience nibbana -- the final bliss.

Ayameva: a+yama+eva ? eva = only, emphatic ("it is just this")

     - kama tanha (sense pleasures)
     - bhav tanha (self) - desire for "I" to be eternal

  3. truth of dukkha nirodha (nibbana)
