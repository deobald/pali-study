Hi Mor!

I am finally getting to this... I apologize for keeping it on my to-do list collecting dust for so long. I wanted to give it meaningful attention and I'm really struggling with email clients these days. Forcing everything to use a dark background creates a lot of difficulties, it seems. ;)

I can't read the blue highlights in my current email client, which is why I'm creating this new email thread. I'll look at your email in Gmail (which my computer is almost too slow to run these days) and reply here. I hope that's okay.

> What do you think?

Personally, I like seeing the Pali at the same size as the English because some of it is recognizable, even to a beginner.

It does feel like the "English (Pali)" format would certainly be more accessible, though. In terms of which should come first, I suppose it perhaps depends which side of the equation you consider the fulcrum of the book: Goenkaji's discourses or the original Pali?


> I hope to get help because I don't think my English is good enough.

Please do let me know when you return to the book actively and get to this stage. I would be more than happy to help with the English introductions. :)


> OK, Although I prefer to avoid notes at the end of the book.

That's fair, though do you mind if I ask why? If it's largely an aesthetic preference you could provide supplementary material online (perhaps through Pariyatti or VRI) to expand on the Pali vocabulary while keeping the book's layout very clean.

This could work, too. I don't mind end-notes personally but it's very important that you keep the book "feeling" the way you want it to feel, since the author is the only person who can really maintain a cohesive vision of what the book is and what it will become. :) Choosing how you include (or exclude) notes is a big part of that. Regarding "thus come" and "thus gone", the paradoxical structure (in English, at least) is fun and fascinating -- but perhaps a long discussion of the meaning belongs in another document more focused on Pali.


> "sambuddha": The word breakdown and explanation could be an end note.

Obviously if there are no end-notes, this explanation should remain where it is. :)


> "(a later text)": What is this referring to?
> To the Pali, of course. isn't clear? 

I think it will be important to be explicit so there is no ambiguity for the reader. Specifically, what is meant by "later" and what is meant by "text"? A brief explanation of which time period you mean by "later" and perhaps the idea that this is not the Pali of the Pali Canon will help readers who are completely unfamiliar with the history of Pali.

I think what you wrote as a compromise works very nicely! It definitely removes the feeling of a "gap" in the reader's potential understanding.


> I like the italics.

Yeah, me too. :) I have found myself using italics almost everywhere for word definitions and references like this my own writing lately. It just feels right.


>> I think this fits well in either "Buddha" or "Sangha" sections 
>> but perhaps it makes more sense where you have it now.
> It is under Sangha... 

Right. You had a note saying "maybe this should go under 'The Buddha'" and I was responding to that. Since this passage is about the Buddha sending out monks to teach, it does feel like "Sangha" is the right choice, as you have it.


> We could have his quote start at 12:50, with "if I am thirsty..." 
> but then "’akkhātāro’ He will just point out: ‘this is the path’. 
> ..." wouldn't work. you think it is better? any other idea?

No, you are right. It only makes sense if you include the entire passage "If I am thirsty but someone else drinks water" etc. It's quite a lot of text by time Goenkaji gets to "Each individual has to work out his own salvation." and would make this section too long.

Too bad. I think especially for a person's first few courses, the stories are much more approachable than their meaning. For early meditators, that will be the part they remember. ;) But as you have it written now, the important part of the message is there in Goenkaji's words and that's what matters most.


> There are many such quotes. is it nessery to use these tape 
> of qoutes in places were Goenkaji "quotes" the Buddha?
> How do You do that kind of a quote?

As many different types of English as there are on Earth, that many types of sub-quoting exist. ;) But you definitely need to sub-quote (where Goenkaji quotes the Buddha) one way or the other.

You can set apart the sub-quotes with bold, italics, a different kind of quotation mark, or even a different font. The only thing that really matters is that the sub-quotes are consistent across the entire document.

Since editing sub-quotes is a consistency thing, it probably does not matter if you choose the final style now. That can be an editing task (maybe keep track of it in your TODO list somewhere?) for the end of the project. Later on, when you have chosen a sub-quote style you like, I can help you go through the entire document and format things so they are consistent everywhere.

Oh, my mistake! Yes, keep it as you have it.


> The SN 46.55 similies would make a wonderful endnote.
> It would be too long for a note, I think. 

Yes, end-notes can be very long (almost essays unto themselves) but if the notes are in-line this will be too long for sure.


> I pretty sure MN 62 is the closest to the way Goenkaji explains them. > And it is very similar.
> this is a standard passage... See also MN 28
> other ways of explaining are derived from the abhidhamma, I belive.

I would be curious about the Abhidhamma passages. The section of Goenkaji's discourse I'm referring to begins around 16:15:

"But that is not the deeper level of the reality. The *characteristic* of each element, which you experience at the sensation level, this is more important.

When you talk of Earth element it is not that you look for a particle of dust in this element. Nothing doing. Water element, you don't look for a drop of water in it. Nothing doing. What is the **sensation** that you feel because of that.

Earth element. The entire field of weight: from the heaviest sensation to the lightest... is the characteristic of the Earth element.

..."

The emphasis given to the elements in terms of one's capacity to experience them as vedana feels more relevant to the practice. MN 62 and MN 28 both address the gross characteristics ("bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil-of-the-joints, urine") and the subtle conclusion of anatta (‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’). But I think it is often easy for readers -- speaking from my own experience, before I ever meditated seriously -- to intellectualize the entire spectrum from the gross observation of internal "waters" and the external waters of the oceans, and their respective impermanence, as those gross observations pertain to an apparent form of impermanence.

Anyway, if you do find the Abhidhamma passage(s) which pertain to the characteristics of the four elements as can be experienced directly in meditation, I would love to read them sometime even if they are not used in the book. :)

Could you link me to the references you have found in the Abhidhamma, its commentaries, and the Visuddhimagga? Again I would be curious to read them even if they do not find their way into the book. :)


> I feel that the order will have to stay in both cases.
> we'll see about the choice of words...

That's fair. You should do whatever you feel is most honest and respects the original intention of the words. The reader can always come back to the order later if it's confusing on the first reading.


> What we see in some later texts is "upakkileso anusayo", 
> but i couldn't find such combination is the suttas.
> I think it's good enough though to have only anusaya.

Hmm, interesting. I suppose it would make sense that Goenkaji would lean on the imagery of "sleeping volcanoes" even one only finds 'anusaya' in isolation in the suttas. It's quite a mental exercise to provide visual images (for first-time meditators) of "underlying tendencies" and the volcano image is very accessible and easy to comprehend for English speakers. I agree that anusaya on its own is good enough.

> I'm not sure that I understand what do you mean...

Ha ha ha! Woof. It's been long enough that when I went back to my own question even I couldn't understand what I meant. It took me a minute or two to remember. ;) I was referring to the Pali in that section:

“cakkhuñca, bhikkhave, paṭicca rūpe ca uppajjati cakkhuviññāṇaṃ, 
tiṇṇaṃ saṅgati phasso, phassapaccayā uppajjati vedayitaṃ 
sukhaṃ vā dukkhaṃ vā adukkhamasukhaṃ vā. ...”

It does not actually contain the word 'anusaya' anywhere, which I think would be helpful to connect the reader between the Pali and Goenkaji's reference to the term 'anusaya'. It feels like in this particular case, an ellipsis could be used between the beginning of the Pali passage and the sentence where 'anusaya' appears?


> Sorry, Steven, but I think that this is the closest sutta we

> Again, the kalāpas are a later development.
> Maybe you are right and it's better to leave this one out...

This is very curious. Are you in touch with any of the Pali scholars from VRI or senior teachers who are familiar with the suttas? It would be so wonderful to piece together meaningful references to 'kalapas', if it's even remotely possible.

If it proves impossible, I assume that referencing later texts is out of the question?


> I think you are going to far hare :)
> I don't think Goenkaji had all that in mind.  
> "how do you learn" sounds OK, but SEEMS a bit odd to me...

Ha ha! I'm sure he didn't have all that in mind. I was just looking for an explanation as to why Goenkaji's English sounds quite natural to me. :) But you're right, I'm probably over-analyzing the whole thing.

> Anyway, I will leave the note so when one of the teachers will

That sounds like a great idea!


> I guess that this is why they want to ask the "chief 
> ministers of justice". luckily he said "gahito ārāmo" :)

Ha ha! Indeed. I suppose Goenkaji elides the whole portion about "chief ministers of justice" because that makes the story quite cumbersome, even if more accurate. ;)

Oh, interesting! If you end up discussing this with a teacher or teachers, I would love to hear what they have to say about it.

---

All the other portions I have responded to thus far are in-order, but I wanted to give this one special attention:

>> See also: Fingers Snap
> Again, this is the closest you'll find in the suttas...
> Such cases made me wonder if this project will be conducive 
> to inspiration or to doubts...

I'm really filled with joy at the thought of this project coming to completion. I know it may take many years, but it will be incredibly beneficial to future students.

Goenkaji's stories do not mirror the suttas perfectly, nor could they. The suttas are long... they are thorough and detailed. But we wouldn't see "... pe ..." everywhere in their English translations if English speakers had the patience for reading or hearing the suttas in their entirety. ;)

On the whole, this project is massively inspirational. I know when I first read through it I kept telling Preethi of all the wonderful connections you had drawn. We were both quite surprised to learn that so much of what Goenkaji teaches is really just a direct transmission of the suttas -- influenced by his own practice and experience as a Vipassana teacher, of course.

Whatever doubts I have had in the past (and whatever doubts remain for me) exist unto themselves. At no point did I read your draft and think "oh, this is disappointing... this causes doubt in my mind." And most of the book dispels even minor doubts about the details of Goenkaji's teaching methods. In that respect, I think this book, even in its current draft form, is conducive to nothing but inspiration. It is unlikely to answer every single question every student will have about Goenkaji's retelling of the stories or his teaching methods. But it will be a wonderful tool for students to examine their own practice more carefully and perhaps to plant the seed of curiosity about Pali and the original discourses. As we both know, that is where pariyatti can really help clear doubts in one's patipatti.


> Thanks a lot Steven, very useful and important notes!
> It is very much appreciated.


You are very welcome! Again, I'm sorry it's taken me so long to respond to this... I feel like there must exist better collaborative writing tools in 2020 than Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and email. But I'm not sure what they are. ;)

This project almost deserves a wiki where we could document different resources and have discussions about individual sections rather than commenting on the entire document back-and-forth? Let me know if that idea interests you at all. I am happy to keep emailing back and forth as well. I can try to be a bit more diligent about my responses in the future.

With metta,
-steven
