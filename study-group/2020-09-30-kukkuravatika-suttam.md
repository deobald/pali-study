pavedita (pp. of pavedeti): declared; made known

The ox-duty ascetic proclaims himself a lay follower of Buddha. The dog-duty ascetic proclaims himself willing to go forth into monkhood. The Buddha explains his probation period of four months and the dog-duty ascetic accepts a probation period of four years. He becomes a monk and attains arahantship.
