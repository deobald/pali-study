# abhayarājakumāra sutta

## To Prince Abhaya (Excerpt from MN 58)

(The prince has asked the Buddha if he speaks words which are displeasing to others. The Buddha says there is no one specific answer, but asks if he had a child on his lap who had something sharp stuck in his mouth, would the prince extract it even if it caused blood to be drawn? The prince said he would.)

### A1

> “evameva kho, rājakumāra, yaṃ tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 
> abhūtaṃ atacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ 
> sā ca paresaṃ appiyā amanāpā, 
> na taṃ tathāgato vācaṃ bhāsati.

> “evameva kho, rājakumāra, 

evameva: in the same way
rājakumāra: prince

> yaṃ tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 

yaṃ vācaṃ: that [speech] / which speech
tathāgato: the buddha (3rd pers.)
vācaṃ: speech
jānāti: knows

> abhūtaṃ atacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ 

abhūtaṃ: a (negation) + bhūta (what is true) = "what is untrue"
atacchaṃ: a (negation) + tacchaṃ (what is just so / what is correct) = "what is incorrect"
    related to the word tathā (thus)
anatthasaṃhitaṃ: a (neg.) natth (benefit) + a (neg.) + saṃhitaṃ (connected)
    => "that is which is not connected with benefit"
    
> sā ca paresaṃ appiyā amanāpā, na taṃ tathāgato vācaṃ bhāsati.

sā ca: "and that"
appiyā: a (neg.) + piyā = "what is dear/beloved" => "unwelcome"
amanāpā: a (neg.) + manā+pā (what is agreeable)
    manā: mind
paresaṃ (dat.): "for others"
taṃ vācaṃ: that [speech] / such speech
na (taṃ) tathāgato (vācaṃ) bhāsati: "the buddha does not speak [that speech]"

> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ appiyā amanāpā, 
> tampi tathāgato vācaṃ na bhāsati.

> yampi tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 

yampi: yam + pi (which also)
vācaṃ: speech
jānāti: knows

> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ appiyā amanāpā, 

bhūtaṃ: true
tacchaṃ: correct
anatthasaṃhitaṃ: not beneficial
sā ca: and that
paresaṃ: to others

amanāpā: not pleasant

> yañca kho tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 
> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ atthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ appiyā amanāpā, 
> tatra kālaññū tathāgato hoti tassā vācāya veyyākaraṇāya.


> yañca kho tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 

but that speech also that the buddha knows

> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ atthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ appiyā amanāpā, 

atthasaṃhitaṃ: beneficial

is true, correct, beneficial [sā ca = and/but] is disagreeable and unendearing to others 

> tatra kālaññū tathāgato hoti tassā vācāya veyyākaraṇāya.

tatra: lit. "there" (when there is speech with those qualities)
kālaññū: kāla (time) + aññū (to know) = "one who knows the time"
tathāgato (subj. nom.)
hoti: "is"

=> lit.: "the tathagat is one who knows the time"

tassā vācāya: "of that speech"
veyyākaraṇāya: lit. "to explain" (bodhi: "to use")

=> lit.: "the tathagat is one who knows the (appropriate) time for the exposition of that speech"

> yaṃ tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 
> abhūtaṃ atacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ piyā manāpā, 
> na taṃ tathāgato vācaṃ bhāsati.

> yaṃ tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 

that speech the tathagat knows

> abhūtaṃ atacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ piyā manāpā, 

which is untrue, incorrect, and unbeneficial [sā ca = but] agreeable and endearing to others

> na taṃ tathāgato vācaṃ bhāsati.

the tathagat will not speak that speech

> yampi tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 
> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ piyā manāpā 
> tampi tathāgato vācaṃ na bhāsati.

> yampi tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 

such speech, too, the tathagat knows

> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ anatthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ piyā manāpā 

which is true, correct, (but) unbeneficial [sā ca = and] agreeable / endearing to others

> tampi tathāgato vācaṃ na bhāsati.

the tathagat will not speak that speech

### A6

> yañca tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 
> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ atthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ piyā manāpā, 
> tatra kālaññū tathāgato hoti tassā vācāya veyyākaraṇāya.

> yañca tathāgato vācaṃ jānāti 

but that speech which the tathagat knows

> bhūtaṃ tacchaṃ atthasaṃhitaṃ sā ca paresaṃ piyā manāpā, 

to be true, correct, connected with benefit [sā ca = but] agreeable / endearing to others 

> tatra kālaññū tathāgato hoti tassā vācāya veyyākaraṇāya.

- As A3:

=> lit.: "there (then) the tathagat is one who knows the (appropriate) time for the exposition of that speech"

> taṃ kissa hetu? 
> atthi, rājakumāra, tathāgatassa sattesu anukampā”ti.

> taṃ kissa hetu? 

kiṃ: "what?"

"that; for what reason?" => "why is that?"

> atthi, rājakumāra, tathāgatassa sattesu anukampā”ti.

atthi: lit. "there is"
tathāgatassa (dat.): "of the tathagata"
sattesu: [in regard to] living beings
anukampā: compassion = "to tremble along with"
    anu = "along with"
    kampati = "to shake"

=> "the tathagat has compassion for all living beings"
