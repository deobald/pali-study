# abhayarājakumāra sutta

## To Prince Abhaya (Excerpt from MN 58)

(The prince has asked the Buddha if he speaks words which are displeasing to others. The Buddha says there is no one specific answer, but asks if he had a child on his lap who had something sharp stuck in his mouth, would the prince extract it even if it caused blood to be drawn? The prince said he would.)
